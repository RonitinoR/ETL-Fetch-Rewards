To deploy this application in prodcution:
1. The application can be containerized through Docker.
2. Using cloud platforms like AWS ECS and Kubernetes to deploy the application by taking scalability, reliability, flexibility and cost management into consideration.

Additional production-ready components:
1. Logging and monitoring (eg. AWS CloudWatch).
2. Error handling and alerting.
3. CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.

Scalability options for the application with a growing dataset:
1. Adopting horizontal scaling through sharding or partitioning techniques.
2. Leveraging NoSQL databases with automatic scaling capabilities.

PII data can be recovered later on by securely storing the original PII data and associating it with the hashed values, further more by implementing the role-based access control to restrict access to sensitive data.

Assumptions:
1. The application is running on a single server or container.
2. The SQS queue and PostgreSQL table are pre-configured and available.
3. The input data format is consistent and matches with the expected schema.
4. Proper access controls and security measures are in place to protect sensitive data.
